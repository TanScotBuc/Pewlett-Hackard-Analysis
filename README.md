# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Overview
I conducted this analysis in order to help prepare Pewlett Hackard for the upcoming spike in retirements due to baby boomers reaching retirement age, and the subsequent abundance of job openings.

### Results
- Senior engineers and senior staff are taking the biggest losses
- The managerial staff will only be losing 2 employees which will keep the leadership core strong
- The engineering department will need a much greater number of new hires with most soon to be retirees being either senior engineers or engineers
-There are significantly more expected openings than mentor-ready employees
